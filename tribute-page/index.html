            <h2>The John von Neumann's History</h2>
            <p class="text-info">John von Neumann (Hungarian: Neumann János Lajos; December 28, 1903 - February 8, 1957)
                was a
                Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath. He was regarded
                as having perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time and was said to have been "the
                last representative of the great mathematicians who were equally at home in both pure and applied
                mathematics". He integrated pure and applied sciences.
                <br>
                <br>
                Von Neumann made major contributions to many fields, including
                <br>
                <br>
            <ul class="text-info list">
                <li>mathematics: (mathematical logic, measure
                    theory, functional analysis, ergodic theory, group theory, lattice theory, representation theory,
                    operator algebras, matrix theory, geometry, and numerical analysis)
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>physics: (quantum mechanics,
                    hydrodynamics & ballistics, nuclear physics and quantum statistical mechanics)
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    economics: (game theory
                    and general equilibrium theory)
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    computing: (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, numerical
                    meteorology, scientific computing, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing) and statistics.
                    He
                    was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of
                    functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular
                    automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer.
