### **I discovered a little bit about:**

### _All HTML tags learned, along with a brief description of each one.:_

- **\<!DOCTYPE html>**: All HTML documents must start with a \<!DOCTYPE> declaration.
- **\<head>**: The \<head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
- **\<meta>**: The \<meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.
- **\<title>**: The \<title> tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
- **\<body>**: The \<body> tag defines the document's body.
- **\<h1> to \<h6>**: The \<h1> to \<h6> tags are used to define HTML headings.
- **\<p>**: The \<p> tag defines a paragraph.
- **\<main>**: The \<main> tag specifies the main content of a document.
- **\<img>**: The \<img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
- **\<a>**: The \<a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
- **\<section>**: The \<section> tag defines a section in a document.
- **\<ul>**: The \<ul> tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list.
- **\<li>**: The \<li> tag defines a list item.

- **\<figcaption>**: The \<figcaption> tag defines a caption for a \<figure> element.
- **\<em>**: The <em> tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
- **\<ol>**: The \<ol> tag defines an ordered list. An ordered list can be numerical or alphabetical.
- **\<strong>**: The \<strong> tag is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.
- **\<form>**: The \<form> tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.
- **\<input>**: The \<input> tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data.
- **\<label>**: The \<label> tag defines a label for several elements.
- **\<fieldset>**: The \<fieldset> tag is used to group related elements in a form.

### _More About:_

- HTML elements have opening tags and closing tags.
- Commenting allows you to leave messages or code inactive.
- HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas.
- Self-closing elements: are just an opening tag with no content and no closing tag.
- Only use one \<h1> per page - this should represent the main heading/subject for the whole page.
