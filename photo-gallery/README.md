### _More About:_

- Flexbox has a main and cross axis.
- The property justify-content is relative to the main axis.
- The property align-items is relative to the cross axis.
- The object-fit property to determine how images should behave.
- The object-position property specifies the alignment of the selected replaced element´s contents within the element´s box.

### _I also added to the project:_

- ### _HTML:_
  - I added \<figure> and \<figcaption> semantic tags to the images.
- ### _CSS:_
  - With CSS I added the effect of hover to the images, then when the user hovers over the image the figcaption tag shows its informations.
